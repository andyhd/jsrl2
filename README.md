Javascript Roguelike 2
======================

I'm refactoring my Javascript Roguelike into a client for a game I am writing.

My current intention is to make it into a non-turn-based tile engine, capable
of rendering Zelda-style games.

More ambitiously / unrealistically, I want to make it communicate with a server
via websockets.
